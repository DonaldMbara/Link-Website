[04/08, 09:58] Donald: Oh okay. Thanks
[04/08, 10:08] Donald: If y'all ain't sure about what to do,  you can do any part of the project then we'll link everything later on
[04/08, 10:34] MJ: Cool, what are you handling at the moment
[04/08, 10:35] Donald: I am handling the JavaScript backend part for login and registration
[04/08, 10:37] Mulisa: Try the solution I proposed, google something like allow access control origin on php
[04/08, 10:38] Donald: Okay thank you..
[04/08, 10:39] MJ: Oh okay 
[04/08, 21:29] Donald: Thanks man. Forgot to update you. It worked


Login and registration is working.

With the home screen. Anyone with a suggestion? Or anyone working on it? You can also check home.html it's my suggestion, but anyone can come up with an alternative
[04/08, 21:32] Donald: I'll be looking at posting  if no one is doing that part.

I hope y'all are working too. You've been quiet lately.
[04/08, 21:53] MJ: I’m still going through some vids online
[04/08, 21:56] MJ: I checked it on my side it looks good man
[04/08, 21:58] MJ: When you sign in done it send you to this home ?
[04/08, 22:01] Donald: No problem.. i thought you doing the event thing
[04/08, 22:01] Donald: Yes. It's a suggestion
[04/08, 22:02] MJ: Oh that’s done I’ll push using that night data, I keep forgetting
[04/08, 22:02] MJ: It looks clean to me 
[04/08, 22:02] Donald: Okay.. just mention everything you do here so that when we do scrum we copy and paste relevant messages
[04/08, 22:03] MJ: Okay cool
[04/08, 22:03] Donald: Awe
[04/08, 22:04] MJ: So the log in should take to to the home neh ?
[04/08, 22:10] Donald: Not yet.I am failing to link it with the login for now even thou the path is correct.. i am using 
*window.location.href = path* after a successful login.
[04/08, 22:11] MJ: Oh damn  eish alright
[04/08, 22:12] MJ: And it didn’t work with just window.location ? 
[04/08, 22:15] Donald: It still takes me to /404 not found page/
[04/08, 22:16] Donald: But if you figure it out along the way sort it out
[04/08, 22:17] MJ: Cool lemme try it
[04/08, 22:23] Donald: Oh.. the reason was that i am doing that inside the home folder so there is not need to include it in the path
[04/08, 22:24] Donald: It is working. I'll push
[04/08, 22:24] MJ: Okay sweet
[04/08, 22:40] MJ: What can we show on the home page , the blank part
[04/08, 22:44] Donald: Ya man. i am not sure yet.. but if you think of something that's cool
[04/08, 22:48] Donald: It's just like a landing page neh?

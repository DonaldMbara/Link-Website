[06/08, 11:17] Donald: How can one send data from one html page to another?
[06/08, 11:18] MJ: Co ask 
[06/08, 11:18] Donald: Let's say i wanna send a user id from login to some html page
[06/08, 11:19] Donald:  lemme know if you find something
[06/08, 11:20] MJ: Cool 
[06/08, 11:20] MJ: Nah I’ll check it out too
[06/08, 12:31] Donald: Oh..i figured out a cool way
[06/08, 12:32] MJ: How ?
[06/08, 12:35] Donald: Give me a sec.. I'll let you know
[06/08, 12:37] MJ: Sho
[06/08, 13:30] Mongezi: i’ll start working at midnight
[06/08, 13:31] MJ: Anybody able to log in or it’s just me ?
[06/08, 13:33] MJ: like the sign in is  not directing
[06/08, 13:53] Donald: Is it showing the alert message?
[06/08, 13:54] MJ: Yes, but after clicking ok nothing happens on my side
[06/08, 13:55] Donald: Okay.lemme push this one then Fetch
[06/08, 13:55] MJ: cool
[06/08, 13:56] Donald: U can pull
[06/08, 13:57] Donald: Don't mind the fact that post.html is not opening for now. I'm trying to send username to post.html, so i pushed incomplete work
[06/08, 13:58] MJ: its cool now 
[06/08, 13:58] MJ: no prob
[06/08, 14:04] Kaone: What if we had a class whose access is controlled and it holds important variables.
Essentially, the ones that must be passed through
[06/08, 14:23] Donald: Yea that would work. Which means the class will hold all the information of the logged in user. .. but i dont know how.
[06/08, 14:28] Donald: As for me I used the link and onclick to transfer data through out the site. It's kinda tricky thou. Because it took me a while trying to brainstorm and deleting some stuff which where not working. I managed to complete posting part yooh yooh...

But since it works, and we can store things in the database. We don't have to worry much about it. 
[06/08, 14:29] MJ: 
[06/08, 14:29] Donald: I commented in all possible ways so that you can understand the process
[06/08, 14:29] Donald: I pushed
[06/08, 14:29] Donald: Like how i did it
[06/08, 14:34] Donald: I couldn't thing of a better way. But if you do. You can do it your way
[06/08, 14:35] Donald: think**
[06/08, 16:49] MJ: Hard coded the profile page and just committed
I’ll give it  the student No a bit later but it works for now 
